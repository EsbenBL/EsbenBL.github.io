San Francisco is a city with a rich history and culture, but unfortunately, it is also known for its high crime rates. Criminal activity in San Francisco has been a persistent issue for many years, affecting the safety and security of residents and visitors alike. Despite efforts by law enforcement and community organizations, crime continues to be a significant problem in the city.

As such, this project aims to explore the extent and nature of criminal activity in San Francisco, with a focus on identifying the most prevalent types of crime, their causes, and their impact on the city's population. The project will use a variety of sources, including crime statistics, police reports, news articles, and interviews with experts in the field, to gain a comprehensive understanding of the issue.

By shedding light on the patterns and trends of criminal activity in San Francisco, this project hopes to contribute to the ongoing efforts to reduce crime and make the city a safer place for everyone.
