<br><br>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
    Let's paint the picture! A boat filled with tired but hopeful families glides across the still morning waters. They have all left their old homes for the promises and opportunities of the new world. In the distance, through the mist, a statue the size of a skyscraper breaks through the morning fog. The mood among the seaworn travellers brightens, realizing that they have finally arrived at their destination. Soon after, a skyline of actual skyscrapers paints the horizon and the bustling sounds of city life fill the air. Sounds familiar? If not, here's a picture to help!

    <p><b>New York City</b> is undeniably one of - if not <i>the</i> most influential and renowned city in western society. In many ways, the city incapsulates the idea The American Dream, with its buzzing streets, opportune business life, and rich cultural scene, spawning sayings like <i>"if you can make it here, you can make it anywhere"</i>. Pop cultural references to New York City is omnipresent in western movies, music, and art and each year <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_by_international_visitors" target="_blank">millions of turists</a> from all over the world flock to the city see all the <i>"familiar"</i> places in real life. <i>The City That Never Sleeps, the Capital of the World, the Big Apple</i> - New York City has earned itself many nicknames. The city has the <a href="http://www.citymayors.com/statistics/richest-cities-2020.html" target="_blank">second highest GDP in the world</a>, and continues to be <a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/epr/05v11n2/0512glae.pdf" target="_blank">the largest city in the USA for over 200 years</a> with a population of around 8.5 million people today. Professor of economics at Harvard University, Edward L. Glaeser, states that <i>"While Boston's history is one of ongoing crises and reinvention (Glaeser 2005), New York's is one of almost unbroken triumph"</i> (Glaeser 2005:1). But what could be the explanation for New York City's urbanizational triumph the last 200 years?
    <br><br>
    Answering this question is a complex task - way too complex for this short data story. Rather, what we seek is to gain a better understanding of New York City's so-called <i>unbroken triuph</i> as a city by mapping the urbanisational development in New York City's journey from a small seed to the Big Apple by using open data, visualizations and statistics. First, we'll examine the history of how New York City took the physical form that we know of today with its bustling streets and 100+ story skyscrapers. Then, we turn to those who the skyscrapers were built by and for, namely the inhabitant of New York City. How did New York City come to be the continouosly most populous city in the US and what role did immigration play in this part of New York City's triumph? Subsequently, we take a contemporary look at New York City and its neighborhood from the perspective of racial segregation. In a multicultural melthing pot such as New York City, which geographical patterns emerges when one observe it through a racial lens? Ultimatly, we'll syntesise the insights that we gained through the three abovementioned sections and discuss where to go from here. Let's dive right in!

<h2>"The Greatest Sunset For A Sight of New York's Skyline"</h2>
<div>
    <p>
    So, the title for this section is a paraphrase of a slightly longer quote by the influential - and somewhat controversial - philosopher Ayn Rand. The skyline of New York City is iconic. Just as the history of hopeful immigrants arriving to New York City on boats from Europe is a central part of the city's identity, so are its towering skyscrapers. The physical appearance of the city has come to shape its economic, social and cultural fabric. Take for instance this very popular picture from 1932 of a band of construction workers taking their lunch break on a beam floating high above the streets of New York. The picture on the right shows the characters from the hugely popular sitcome <i>Friends</i>, doing more of less the same thing.

    <p>
    The history of how New York City came to be The Big Apple - economicaly, socially, and culturally - thus have to include the history of how the city developed it's physical form. Therefore, this will also be our point of departure.
    <br><br>
    In <b>Figure 1</b>, we plot a temporal heatmap of the geographical development of New York City's constructional body, dating all the way back from 1800 up until 2022. The red markers represent construction for <b>primarily residential use</b> while the blue markers indicate <b>commercial/industrial construction</b>. We have also outlined the 5 boroughs that jointly constitutes New York City: <b>Manhattan, Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens, and Staten Island</b>.
    <br><br>
    <i><b>Please Note</b></i>: Per default, the plot is paused and the <i>"layers"</i> controlling whether the residential and/or commercial construction are visible are both turned off. <b>Turn the layers on</b> through the layer-control in the top right corner and <b>press play</b> to initiate the temporal animation. Otherwise, feel free to zoom in and explore the construction of New York City on your own!
    </p>

    <h4 style="text-align:center">Figure 1: Geographical Distribution of Residential and Commercial Construction over Time</h4>

    <p>
    Activating both the residential- and commercial <i>"layer"</i> in the map and pressing play, one can see how New York City's journey from seed to apple started with residential- and industrial life making their way <b>from Manhattan out into Brooklyn</b> during the 19th century. Quite quickly, starting around 1900, the map becomes rather cluttered and at times one can hardly spot any of the underlying map simply due to the excessive degree of construction. Both residential- and industrial life spread rapidly <b>out into Queens, Bronx, and Staten Island</b> throughout the early 20th century, ultimately taking up nearly all available space in all 5 boroughs. 
    <br><br>
    With this broad geographical impression of how the buildings of New York City arose over the years, let's get a little more specify in how we quantify construction. After all, all building are not created equal and it would be unfair to equate a single story house on Staten Island with a 100+ story skyscraber in Manhattan. <b>Figure 2</b> displays the accumulated number of square feet constructed within each decade since 1800-2020, with all construction before 1900 grouped together. 
    </p>

<div class="center">
    <h4 style="text-align:center">Figure 2: Constructed Square Feet by Decade</h4>
    <img src="/assets/exam_assets/squarefeet_by_decade.png">
</div>
<br>
    <p>
    <br><br>
    The immediatly most notable decade with regard to overall construction is the <b>1920s</b> - a decade appropriatly known as <b>"the Roaring Twenties"</b> or <b><a href="https://www.encyclopedia.com/history/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/prosperity-decade-1921-1928-overview" target="_blank">"the Prosperity Decade"</a></b>. More than 800 million square feet (roughly 74 square kilometers) of building was constructed in New York City during that time. Nearing the end of a a decade characterised by wealth, progression, and prosperity in the wake of World War I, the Roaring Twenties concluded with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street_Crash_of_1929" target="_blank">the Wall Street Crash in October of 1929</a>, hurling not just New York City's economy, but the global economy as a whole into an economic depression called <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression" target="_blank">the Great Depression</a></b>. Being a time of economic recession, this might be part of the explaination for the relativly lower degree of construction that we see in the <b>1930s</b> compared to its preceding decade. Looking at the <b>1940s</b> (one of the least constructional decades in 200 years) and the noticably lower amount of construction compared to its pre- and succeeding decades, it seemes obvious to mention World War II from 1939-1945 as the main reason behind this decrease. Moving on to the <b>1950s and 1960s</b>, both decades are rather productive with regard to construction in New York City. Business was once again booming during the <b><a href="https://www.lcps.org/cms/lib/VA01000195/Centricity/Domain/20199/1950s%20Prosperity.pdf" target="_blank">"the prosperous 50s"</a></b> and <b><a href="https://www.venstre.dk/partiet/skoleweb/politisk-historie/velfaerd-og-vaelgerskred/de-glade-tressere" target="_blank">"the happy 60s"</a></b> (a danish nickname for the decade), both periods characterised by economic growth. Old habits die hard and, once again, a period of growth is followed by a period of recession. From a constructional standpoint, the <b>1970s, 1980s, and 1990s</b> stand out as being among the least productive in shaping the physical fabric of New York City - especially with regard to residential construction. From a broader, historical standpoint, the 1970s underwent a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1970s_energy_crisis" target="_blank"> global energy crisis</a> while both the 1970s and 1980s mark a particularly challenging period in New York City's history with regard to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/new-york-city-used-to-be-a-terrifying-place-photos-2013-7?r=US&IR=T" target="_blank">social challenges and crime prevention</a>. However, New York City was not the only metropolis with challenges and most every larger cities during this perod fared even worse than New York City (Glaeser 2005:20).  
    <br><br>
    All in all, the constructional history of New York City tells a story about the world around it. Economic Prosperity, energy crises, world wars, and economic depressions are all manifested in Figure 2. Now, let's nuance the picture even further, and examine the history of residential- and commercial construction within each of the 5 boroughs of New York City. 
    <br><br>
    <b>Figure 3</b> presents the accumulated number of square feet constructed within each decade - just like Figure 2 - but subdivided into the borough of New York City. 
    </p>
<div>
    <h4 style="text-align:center">Figure 3: Constructed Square Feet by Decade and Borough</h4>
    <img src="/assets/exam_assets/squarefeet_by_borough.png" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;">
</div>
<br>
    <p>
    The relation between commercial and residential seems to be quite steady through time, with the highest share of commercial construction during the 1990s - a time characterised in pop culture by yuppies on Manhattan (ER VIDST 1980'erne faktisk) - where circa half of all construction was meant for commercial use. On the other hand, the 1940 have the highest share of residential construction compared to commercial. 

<h2>A City Build By Immigrants</h2>
    <p>
    We look into migrational development as a lot of the cultural and historical identity of New York City is inadvertently tied to its status as <a href="https://www.osc.state.ny.us/files/reports/osdc/pdf/report-7-2016.pdf" target="_blank">a city build by migrants</a>. Thus we hope by visualizing patterns in the urbanisational development of New York City with commercialization and migration as our points of interest, we become able to see the historical effects through time, while understanding contemporary New York City better.

<h2>Bus-Proof Overpasses and Racial Segregation</h2>
<p>
New York City's triumph - as described by Glaeser - is undeniable but also rather simplified. Maybe even somewhat sugar coated. Yes, New York City is populous and contributed with a high GDP, but the city is not without its problems. SOCIAL PROBLEMS! An example thereof is the infamous and contested story about the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-09/robert-moses-and-his-racist-parkway-explained" target="_blank">instruction to design certain overpasses to be too low for busses to go under them</a> in order to keep black and puerto rican families away from certain areas, as these racial groups would generally not own cars, thus relying on busses for transportation. Whether true or not, the existence of such stories reflects that racial tension and challenges is not a foreign debate in New York City.
