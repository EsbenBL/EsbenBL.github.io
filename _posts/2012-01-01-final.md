<p style="color:white">From Seed To Apple in New York City</p>
<br><br>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
    Let's paint the picture! A boat filled with tired but hopeful families glides across the still morning waters. They have all left their old homes for the promises and opportunities of the new world. In the distance, through the mist, a statue the size of a skyscraper breaks through the morning fog. The mood among the seaworn travellers brightens, realizing that they have finally arrived at their destination. Soon after, a skyline of actual skyscrapers paints the horizon and the bustling sounds of city life fill the air. Sounds familiar? If not, here's a picture to help!

    <p><b>New York City</b> is undeniably one of - if not <i>the</i> most influential and renowned city in western society. In many ways, the city incapsulates the idea The American Dream, with its buzzing streets, opportune business life, and rich cultural scene, spawning sayings like <i>"if you can make it here, you can make it anywhere"</i>. Pop cultural references to New York City is omnipresent in western movies, music, and art and each year <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_by_international_visitors" target="_blank">millions of turists</a> from all over the world flock to the city see all the <i>"familiar"</i> places in real life. <i>The City That Never Sleeps, the Capital of the World, the Big Apple</i> - New York City has earned itself many nicknames. The city has the <a href="http://www.citymayors.com/statistics/richest-cities-2020.html" target="_blank">second highest GDP in the world</a>, and continues to be <a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/epr/05v11n2/0512glae.pdf" target="_blank">the largest city in the USA for over 200 years</a> with a population of around 8.5 million people today. Professor of economics at Harvard University, Edward L. Glaeser, states that <i>"While Boston's history is one of ongoing crises and reinvention (Glaeser 2005), New York's is one of almost unbroken triumph"</i> (Glaeser 2005:1). But what could be the explanation for New York City's urbanizational triumph the last 200 years?
    <br><br>
    Answering this question is a complex task - way too complex for this short data story. Rather, what we seek is to gain a better understanding of New York City's so-called <i>unbroken triuph</i> as a city by mapping the urbanisational development in New York City's journey from a small seed to the Big Apple by using open data, visualizations and statistics. First, we'll examine the history of how New York City took the physical form that we know of today with its bustling streets and 100+ story skyscrapers. Then, we turn to those who the skyscrapers were built by and for, namely the inhabitant of New York City. How did New York City come to be the continouosly most populous city in the US and what role did immigration play in this part of New York City's triumph? Subsequently, we take a contemporary look at New York City and its neighborhood from the perspective of racial segregation. In a multicultural melthing pot such as New York City, which geographical patterns emerges when one observe it through a racial lens? Ultimatly, we'll syntesise the insights that we gained through the three abovementioned sections and discuss where to go from here. Let's dive right in!

<h2>The Greatest Sunset For A Sight of New York's Skyline</h2>
<div>
    <p>
    So, the title for this section is a paraphrase of a slightly longer qoute by the influential - and somewhat controversial - philosopher Ayn Rand. The skyline of New York City is iconic. Just as the history of hopeful immigrants arriving to New York City on boats from Europe is a central part of the city's identity, so are its towering skyscrapers. The physical appearance of the city has come to shape its economic, social and cultural fabric. Take for instance this very popular picture from 1932 of a band of construction workers taking their lunch break on a beam floating high above the streets of New York. The picture on the right shows the characters from the hugely popular sitcome <i>Friends</i>, doing more of less the same thing.

    <p>
    The history of how New York City came to be The Big Apple - economicaly, socially, and culturally - thus have to include the history of how the city developed it's physical form. Therefore, this will also be our point of departure.

<h2>A City Build By Immigrant</h2>
    <p>
    We look into migrational development as a lot of the cultural and historical identity of NYC is inadvertently tied to its status as <a href="https://www.osc.state.ny.us/files/reports/osdc/pdf/report-7-2016.pdf" target="_blank">a city build by migrants</a>. Thus we hope by visualizing patterns in the urbanisational development of NYC with commercialization and migration as our points of interest, we become able to see the historical effects through time, while understanding contemporary NYC better.

<h2>Bus-Proof Overpasses and Racial Segregation</h2>
<p>
New York City's triumph - as described by Glaeser - is undeniable but also rather simplified. Maybe even somewhat sugar coated. Yes, New York City is populous and contributed with a high GDP, but the city is not without its problems. SOCIAL PROBLEMS! An example thereof is the infamous and contested story about the<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-09/robert-moses-and-his-racist-parkway-explained" target="_blank">instruction to design certain overpasses to be too low for busses to go under them</a> in order to keep black and puerto rican families away from certain areas, as these racial groups would generally not own cars, thus relying on busses for transportation. Whether true or not, the existence of such stories reflects that racial tension and challenges is not a foreign debate in New York City.
