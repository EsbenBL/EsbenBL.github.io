<br><br>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
    <div>
        <p>
        Let's paint the picture! A boat filled with tired but hopeful families glides across the still morning waters. They have all left their old homes for the promises and opportunities of the new world. In the distance, through the mist, a statue the size of a skyscraper breaks through the morning fog. The mood among the seaworn travellers brightens, realizing that they have finally arrived at their destination. Soon after, a skyline of actual skyscrapers paints the horizon and the bustling sounds of city life fill the air. Sounds familiar? If not, here's a picture to help!

        <p><b>New York City</b> is undeniably one of - if not <i>the</i> most influential and renowned city in western society. In many ways, the city incapsulates the idea The American Dream, with its buzzing streets, opportune business life, and rich cultural scene, spawning sayings like <i>"if you can make it here, you can make it anywhere"</i>. Pop cultural references to New York City is omnipresent in western movies, music, and art and each year <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_by_international_visitors" target="_blank">millions of turists</a> from all over the world flock to the city see all the <i>"familiar"</i> places in real life. <i>The City That Never Sleeps, the Capital of the World, the Big Apple</i> - New York City has earned itself many nicknames. The city has the <a href="http://www.citymayors.com/statistics/richest-cities-2020.html" target="_blank">second highest GDP in the world</a>, and continues to be <a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/epr/05v11n2/0512glae.pdf" target="_blank">the largest city in the USA for over 200 years</a> with a population of around 8.5 million people today. Professor of economics at Harvard University, Edward L. Glaeser, states that <i>"While Boston's history is one of ongoing crises and reinvention (Glaeser 2005), New York's is one of almost unbroken triumph"</i> (Glaeser 2005:1). But what could be the explanation for New York City's urbanizational triumph the last 200 years?
        <br><br>
        Answering this question is a complex task - way too complex for this short data story. Rather, what we seek is to gain a better understanding of New York City's so-called <i>unbroken triuph</i> as a city by mapping the urbanisational development in New York City's journey from a small seed to the Big Apple by using open data, visualizations and statistics. First, we'll examine the history of how New York City took the physical form that we know of today with its bustling streets and 100+ story skyscrapers. Then, we turn to those who the skyscrapers were built by and for, namely the inhabitant of New York City. How did New York City come to be the continouosly most populous city in the US and what role did immigration play in this part of New York City's triumph? Subsequently, we take a contemporary look at New York City and its neighborhood from the perspective of racial segregation. In a multicultural melthing pot such as New York City, which geographical patterns emerges when one observe it through a racial lens? Ultimatly, we'll syntesise the insights that we gained through the three abovementioned sections and discuss where to go from here. Let's dive right in!
        </p>
<h2>"The Greatest Sunset For A Sight of New York's Skyline"</h2>
    <div>
        <p>
        So, the title for this section is a paraphrase of a slightly longer quote by the influential - and somewhat controversial - philosopher Ayn Rand. The skyline of New York City is iconic. Just as the history of hopeful immigrants arriving to New York City on boats from Europe is a central part of the city's identity, so are its towering skyscrapers. The physical appearance of the city has come to shape its economic, social and cultural fabric. Take for instance this very popular picture from 1932 of a band of construction workers taking their lunch break on a beam floating high above the streets of New York. The picture on the right shows the characters from the hugely popular sitcome <i>Friends</i>, doing more of less the same thing.

    <h4>The Skyscrabers of New York City</h4>

    <br>
        <p>
        The history of how New York City came to be The Big Apple - economicaly, socially, and culturally - thus have to include the history of how the city developed it's physical form. Therefore, this will also be our point of departure.
        <br><br>
        In <b>Figure 1</b>, we plot a temporal heatmap of the geographical development of New York City's constructional body, dating all the way back from 1800 up until 2022. The red markers represent construction for <b>primarily residential use</b> while the blue markers indicate <b>commercial/industrial construction</b>. We have also outlined the 5 boroughs that jointly constitutes New York City: <b>Manhattan, Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens, and Staten Island</b>.
        <br><br>
        <i><b>Please Note</b></i>: Per default, the plot is paused and the <i>"layers"</i> controlling whether the residential and/or commercial construction are visible are both turned off. <b>Turn the layers on</b> through the layer-control in the top right corner and <b>press play</b> to initiate the temporal animation. Otherwise, feel free to zoom in and explore the construction of New York City on your own!
        </p>
    <h2></h2>
    <div>
        <h4 style="text-align:center">Figure 1: Geographical Distribution of Residential and Commercial Construction over Time</h4>
        <embed 
            type="text/html" 
            src="/assets/exam_assets/construction_heatmap.html"
            width="1050px"
            height="600px"
            >
    </div>
    <br>
        <p>
        Activating both the residential- and commercial <i>"layer"</i> in the map and pressing play, one can see how New York City's journey from seed to apple started with residential- and industrial life making their way <b>from Manhattan out into Brooklyn</b> during the 19th century. Quite quickly, starting around 1900, the map becomes rather cluttered and at times one can hardly spot any of the underlying map simply due to the excessive degree of construction. Both residential- and industrial life spread rapidly <b>out into Queens, Bronx, and Staten Island</b> throughout the early 20th century, ultimately taking up nearly all available space in all 5 boroughs. 
        <br><br>
        With this broad geographical impression of how the buildings of New York City arose over the years, let's get a little more specify in how we quantify construction. After all, all building are not created equal and it would be unfair to equate a single story house on Staten Island with a 100+ story skyscraber in Manhattan. <b>Figure 2</b> displays the accumulated number of square feet constructed within each decade since 1800-2020, with all construction before 1900 grouped together. 
        </p>
    <div class="center">
        <h4 style="text-align:center">Figure 2: Constructed Square Feet by Decade</h4>
        <img src="/assets/exam_assets/squarefeet_by_decade.png">
    </div>
    <br>
        <p>
        The relation between residential and commercial construction seems to be quite steady over time, with the highest share of commercial construction during the 1990s where approximately half of all construction was meant for commercial use. In the opposite end, the 1940s have the highest share of residential construction compared to commercial. 
        <br><br>
        The immediatly most notable decade with regard to overall construction is the <b>1920s</b> - a decade appropriatly known as <b>"the Roaring Twenties"</b> or <b><a href="https://www.encyclopedia.com/history/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/prosperity-decade-1921-1928-overview" target="_blank">"the Prosperity Decade"</a></b>. More than 800 million square feet (roughly 74 square kilometers) of building was constructed in New York City during that time. Nearing the end of a a decade characterised by wealth, progression, and prosperity in the wake of World War I, the Roaring Twenties concluded with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street_Crash_of_1929" target="_blank">the Wall Street Crash in October of 1929</a>, hurling not just New York City's economy, but the global economy as a whole into an economic depression called <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression" target="_blank">the Great Depression</a></b>. Being a time of economic recession, this might be part of the explaination for the relativly lower degree of construction that we see in the <b>1930s</b> compared to its preceding decade. Looking at the <b>1940s</b> (one of the least constructional decades in 200 years) and the noticably lower amount of construction compared to its pre- and succeeding decades, it seemes obvious to mention World War II from 1939-1945 as the main reason behind this decrease. Moving on to the <b>1950s and 1960s</b>, both decades are rather productive with regard to construction in New York City. Business was once again booming during the <b><a href="https://www.lcps.org/cms/lib/VA01000195/Centricity/Domain/20199/1950s%20Prosperity.pdf" target="_blank">"the prosperous 50s"</a></b> and <b><a href="https://www.venstre.dk/partiet/skoleweb/politisk-historie/velfaerd-og-vaelgerskred/de-glade-tressere" target="_blank">"the happy 60s"</a></b> (a danish nickname for the decade), both periods characterised by economic growth. Old habits die hard and, once again, a period of growth is followed by a period of recession. From a constructional standpoint, the <b>1970s, 1980s, and 1990s</b> stand out as being among the least productive in shaping the physical fabric of New York City - especially with regard to residential construction. From a broader, historical standpoint, the 1970s underwent a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1970s_energy_crisis" target="_blank"> global energy crisis</a> while both the 1970s and 1980s mark a particularly challenging period in New York City's history with regard to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/new-york-city-used-to-be-a-terrifying-place-photos-2013-7?r=US&IR=T" target="_blank">social challenges and crime prevention</a>. The resemblance between New York City and Batman's crime-ridden city of Gotham does not come out of nothing. However, New York City was not the only metropolis with challenges and most every larger cities during this perod fared even worse than New York City (Glaeser 2005:20).  
        <br><br>
        All in all, the constructional history of New York City tells a story about the world around it. Economic Prosperity, social tensions, energy crises, world wars, and economic depressions are all manifested in Figure 2. Now, let's nuance the picture even further and examine the history of residential- and commercial construction within each of the 5 boroughs of New York City. 
        <br><br>
        <b>Figure 3</b> presents the accumulated number of square feet constructed within each decade - just like Figure 2 - but subdivided into the boroughs of New York City. 
        </p>
    <div>
        <h4 style="text-align:center">Figure 3: Constructed Square Feet by Decade and Borough</h4>
        <img src="/assets/exam_assets/squarefeet_by_borough.png">
    </div>
    <br>
        <p>
        <b>Brooklyn and Manhattan</b> stand out as the boroughs with the highest amount of construction during a single decade. For Manhattan, that decade is unsurprisingly the Roaring Twenties, while Brooklyn actually peaks during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Compared to the other boroughs, <b>Manhattan</b> clearly has the generally largest proportion of commercial construction relative to residential. Manhattan houses New York City's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_business_district" target="_blank">Central Business District</a> (CBD), which also happens to be the largest CBD in the world. From Figure 3, we clearly see that commercial construction has been prioritized in Manhattan over the years, allowing it to evolve into the worlds largest CBD. The foundation for this epicenter of capitalism was laid during the 1920s, a period of <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/built-for-business-midtown-manhattan-in-the-1920s/239257" target="_blank">commercial transformation in Manhattan</a>.
        <br><br>
        From Figure 3, we find that not all boroughs are effected equally by the abovementioned social, economic, and political events - or at least that the events spark different reactions. For instance, while both Brooklyn, Manhattan, Bronx, and - to some extent - Staten Island all seem to be noticably effected by World War II during the 1940s, <b>Queens</b> retains a rather high degree of residential construction during this time period.  
        <br><br>
        Lastly, it is apparent that <b>Staten Island</b> has considerably fewer constructed square feet compared to the other boroughs. Contrary to the others, Staten Island experienced its most constructive decades during the later half of the 20th century. This could probably be related to the fact that other borough are getting more and more cramped for space, while Staten Island becomes more infrastructurally connected with the rest of New York City. For instance, the renowned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verrazzano-Narrows_Bridge" target="_blank">Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge</a> was built between Brooklyn and Staten Island in 1964, allowing for easier commuting between Staten Island and the many square feet of commerical space in Manhattan - maybe. This highlights the importance of critical infrastructure in managing urban space and opening up new areas for residential inflow. 
        </p>

<h2>A City Built By Migrants</h2>
    <div>
        <p>
        So, we now have a broad impression of New York City's journey from seed to apple from the perspective of the city's physical structure. Next, we'll turn from looking at the construction of skyscraper to looking at those whom the skyscrabers are built by and for - <b>the people of New York City</b>. Just as the skyscrapers are an integral part of New York City's identity, so is the city's history with immigrants ariving from the <i>"old world"</i> seeking a better life in the <i>"new world"</i>. Its not for nothing that New York has been called <a href="https://www.osc.state.ny.us/files/reports/osdc/pdf/report-7-2016.pdf" target="_blank">a city built by migrants</a>. We'll keep the insights from the previous section on New York City's construction in mind to hopefully attain a deeper understanding of how the inhabitants are affected by the physical construction of the city - or maybe vice versa. For instance, what happens when a city prioritizes building commercial structures rather than residential, as is the case with Manhattan? How has this affected contemporary New York City? Let's try and find out!
        <br><br>
        <b>Figure 4</b> displays the developments in the population of New York City from 1900 to 2020 within each of the 5 boroughs and in New York City in total. Population projections for the estimated population in 2030 and 2040 are presented with dotted line.
        </p>
    <div class="center">
        <h4 style="text-align:center">Figure 4: Population by Borough</h4>
        <img src="/assets/exam_assets/population_by_borough.png">
    </div>
    <br>
        <p>
        In Figure 4, we see that the population of New York City grew most rapidly during the early 20th century, roughly <b>doubling in size from 1900 to 1950</b>. Subsequently, however, the population growth staggered and even <b>decreased between 1970 and 1980</b>. Since then, the overall population has been steadily increasing for each decade, and based on the population projection, this growth will continue going forward. 
        <br><br>
        Looking at the individual boroughs, <b>Brooklyn and Queens</b> have undergone the most significant population growth, with Brooklyn overtaking Manhattan as the most populous borough during the 1920s, and Queens clocking in on second place sometime during the 1950s. Recalling <b>Figure 3</b>, we learned that construction in Brooklyn and Queens was mostly focused on residential buildings, whereas Manhattan to a higher degree prioritized commerical construction. We now see, that while <b>Manhattan</b> started off as the most populous borough in 1900 - housing nearly half of New York City's population at the time - it's population has steadily decreased throughout the 20th century and will continue to do so judging bý the population projections. Soon, <b>Bronx</b> will probably also overtake Manhattan. The decreasing population in Manhattans is most likely a direct result of the borough's evolution into being the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_business_district" target="_blank">Central Business District</a> of the world, thus <i>pushing</i> citizens from out into the other boroughs. 
        <br><br>
        Furthermore, we also recall from Figure 3 that construction generally descreased significantly during the 1940s in all boroughs aside from <b>Queens</b>. In Figure 4, we see that while Brooklyn, Manhattan, Bronx, and Staten Island hardly had any population inflow, the population in Queens actually increased quite noticably during this time. We also see, that the decrease in New York City's overall population during the economic recession, social challenges, and energy crisis in the 1970s is primarily caused by a decreasing in the population in Brooklyn and Bronx, as well as a stagnation in Queens's population growth. Though Glaeser (2003) argues that New York City did relatively well during this period of time, living in New York City in the 1970s was not <i>"all beer and skittles"</i>. To make matters worse, the already ongoing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_New_York_City_(1946%E2%80%931977)" target="_blank">fiscal crisis</a> was amplified by a large movement of middle-class residents out of the city into the suburbs, leaving a whole in the city's tax revenue reserve. This movement is apparent in Figure 4. 
        <br><br>
        Also on <b>Staten Island</b>, we see that the population is tightly linked to the constructional activity of the borough. Staten Island has a relatively small population compared to the other boroughs, but is steadily increasing its population - mostly so during the later half of the 20th century. As mentioned in Figure 3, this is probably related to the construction of critical infrastructure, such as bridges, connectiong Staten Island to the rest of New York City. 
        <br><br>
        Now, let's zoom in on those who allegedly built the city; <b>migrants</b> - or more specifically, immigrants. <b>Figure 5</b> consists of two parts; On top, it presents the foreign born population of New York City and its boroughs from 1900 to 2010. Below, the share of foreign born relative to the total population is plotted. 
        </p>
    <div class="center">
        <h4 style="text-align:center">Figure 5: Foreign Born Population by Borough from 1900-2010</h4>
        <img src="/assets/exam_assets/foreign_And_share_population_by_borough.png">
    </div>
    <br>
        <p>
        Alright, so we are back at the picture from the introduction where a boatload of travellers greet the Statue of Liberty hello. In <b>Figure 5</b>, it is apparant that especially <b>Manhattan</b> consisted of a rather large share of foreign borns at the entrance to the 20th century, with almost half (corresponding to roughly 1 million people) of Manhattan's population being born in a different country in <b>1910</b>. However, throughout the following decades, all the way up <b>until 1970</b>, Manhattan has seen a constanst decrease both in the total number of foreign borns and their relative share of the total population. In <b>1970</b>, only about 20% - or 500.000 people - of Manhattans population were foreign born. In fact, all of the boroughs - aside from Queens - saw a decrease in both the total and relative number of foreign borns from around <b>1930 to 1970</b> - recall from <b>Figure 4</b> that New York City generally experienced a population growth during this period. The fall in both the total number and the share indicate that the decrease in the foreign born population is not due to a general migration out of the boroughs of New York City, but rather because specifcally the foreign born population either moves out or - well - dies. In <b>1921</b>, the United States enforced a new immigration police called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Quota_Act" target="_blank">Emergency Quota Act</a>, which restricted immigrantion quite heavily based on the nationality of those already residing in the US. The Emergency Quota Act is a central part of US immigration history and is inevitably reflected in Figure 5. 
        <br><br>
        From <b>1970 and onward</b>, all boroughs have undergone a steady increase in foreign born residents - both in total and in the share of the population. In 1965, the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2015/09/30/how-u-s-immigration-laws-and-rules-have-changed-through-history/" target="_blank">Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965</a> was passed, abolishing the Emergency Quota Act of 1921 in favor of a less restrictive - and less discriminating - immigration policy. The effects of this law are obvious in Figure 5. The increasing foreign born population could also have something to do with the abovementioned movement of middle-class residents out of the city and into the suburbs, leaving space for foreign born residents to take up. Especially <b>Queens</b> have had a noticable inflow of foreign born residents. Almost inversely mirroring the development in Manhattan, Queens have gone from housing hardly any foreign born residents in 1900, to having roughly 1 million foreign born inhabitants in 2010 constituing nearly half of the boroughs population. 
        </p>
<h2>Bus-Proof Overpasses and Racial Segregation</h2>
    <div>
        <p>
        New York City's triumph - as described by Glaeser - is undeniable but also rather simplified. Maybe even somewhat sugar coated. Yes, New York City is populous and contributed with a high GDP, but the city is not without its problems. We have already talked about the social distress during the 1970, with <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/new-york-city-used-to-be-a-terrifying-place-photos-2013-7?r=US&IR=T" target="_blank">soaring crime rates, heroin and cocain abuse, and corruption</a>. Another example the city history with social tension, is the infamous and contested story about the instruction to design certain <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-09/robert-moses-and-his-racist-parkway-explained" target="_blank">overpasses to be too low for busses to go under them</a> in order to keep black and puerto rican families away from certain areas, as these racial groups would generally not own cars, thus relying on busses for transportation. Whether true or not, the existence of such stories reflects that racial tension and challenges is not a foreign debate in New York City. 
        <br><br>
        Condencing everything we have learned up until now, we now have a broad but solid impression of the evolution of both the physical and social development of New York City all the way from 1800 up until today. We now wish to take a more contemporary look at New York City and how its physical and social development manifests itself in the cities residential composition today. Concretely, we want to take a look at neighborhood segregation in New York City from a racial perspective. In a multicultural melthing pot such as New York City, which geographical patterns emerges when one observe it through a racial lens. For instance, how is the relatively high degree of commercial construction on Manhattan during the 20th centuery reflected in the characteristics of contemporary Manhattanites?

        <b>Figure 6</b> show the based on self-reported racial attributes - Note that the respondents were able to chose multiple races if relevant. We have chosen an inclusive approach and the reported shared can therefore sum to more than 100% within neighborhoods.

        Generally, `Figure 6` show how the neighborhoods in New York City is highly segregated based on racial characteristics. The white population in New York City is mainly clustered on Manhattan, Brooklyn and Staten Island. A broad observation regarding the areas with white people is that beside Staten Island, it seems that the white population are a majority in neighborhoods centred more in middle of NYC (ie. The northern part of Brooklyn, the southern and middle part of Manhattan, and the left side of Queens). The asian population seem to live rather close to the white population. Besides small enclaves, such as the one centered at Manhattan which we will look more into in the next figure, the highest percent areas of Asians are in Brooks and Brooklyn and is rather closely intertwined with the white population in these two boroughs.

        The black population is very much centered around certain neighbourhoods in Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens. The hispanic/latino population seem more spread out than the other ethnicityes, but are especially centred in Bronx. Thus Bronx seems to be mostly a hispanic/latino and black neighbourhood, with the exception of the white population living by the ocean in the northern part of Bronx.

        In Figure 6 we mentioned a small enclave of asian residents in the middle of multiple white neighboorhoods in Manhattan. In `Figure 7` we can look at this more in depth see that this specific neighborhood is  *Chinatown-Two Bridges*, which makes logically sense is predominantly asian.

        Just below Bronx and above Queens we see the renown prison island of NYC (*Rikers Island*) with at that time its 6000 prisoners. In this prison one can observe a population of 49,1% self-reporting as black, 40,2% self-reporting as white, 32,5% self-reporting as hispanic/latino, and only 2.7% self-reporting as asian. The council 
        of NYC has planned
        <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/rikers-island-is-supposed-to-close-in-2027-so-why-is-mayor-adams-talking-about-plan-b" target="_blank">to build four new prisons as to move the prisons closer to families and courthouses</a> (Katz 2023). It would be interesting to see what kind of changes this would bring to the four neighborhoods.  
        <br><br>
        If one looks on the east side of the predominantly white Staten Island, one sees the neighborhood of *Miller Field*, which is the only predominantly black neighborhood in a largely white zone. Looking into 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller_Field_(Staten_Island)" target="_blank">Miller Field</a>
        , one sees that this area is actually an old military facility which mostly has been transformed into park now, then it also makes sense that when looking into the amount of total population of Miller Field it only has 260 citizens. Therefore one should be careful since a very low amount of answers in the survey data would be able to change the share of different ethnicities quite a lot in this neighborhood.
