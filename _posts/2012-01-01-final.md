<h2>Introduction</h2>
<div> 
    <p>Let's paint the picture! A boat filled with tired but hopeful families glides across the still morning waters. They have all left their old homes for the promises and opportunities of the new world. In the distance, through the mist, a statue the size of a skyscraper breaks through the morning fog. The mood among the seaworn travellers brightens, realizing that they have finally arrived at their destination. Soon after, a skyline of actual skyscrapers paints the horizon and the bustling sounds of city life fill the air. Sounds familiar?<br><br>

New York City is undeniably one of - if not *the* most influential and renowned city in western society. In many ways, the city incapsulates the idea The American Dream, with its buzzing streets, opportune business life, and rich cultural scene, spawning sayings like *"if you can make it here, you can make it anywhere"*. Pop cultural references to New York City is omnipresent in western movies, music, and art and each year [millions of turists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_by_international_visitors) from all over the world flock to the city see all the "familiar" places in real life. *The City that never sleeps*, *the Capital of the World*, *the Big Apple* - New York City has earned itself many nicknames. The City has the [second highest GDP in the world](http://www.citymayors.com/statistics/richest-cities-2020.html), and continues to be [the largest city in the USA for over 200 years](https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/epr/05v11n2/0512glae.pdf) with a population of around 8.5 million people today. Professor of economics at Harvard University, Edward L. Glaeser, states that *"While Boston's history is one of ongoing crises and reinvention (Glaeser 2005), New York's is one of almost unbroken triumph"* (Glaeser 2005:1). But what could be the explanation for NYC's urbanizational triumph the last 200 years?

Just as the history of hopeful immigrants arriving to New York City on boats from Europe is a central part of the city's identity, so are it's iconic skyscraper. The physical appearance of the city have come to shape it's economic, social and cultural fabric. Take for instance this very popular picture from 1932 of a band of construction workers taking their lunch break on a beam floating high above the streets of New York. The picture on the right shows the characters from the hugely popular sitcome *Friends*, doing more of less the same thing.

The history of how New York City came to be The Big Apple - economicaly, socially, and culturally - thus have to include the history of how the city's developed it's physical form. 


Answering this question is a complex task, but we seek to give the reader a more granular understanding of the urbanisational development of NYC by using visualizations and statistics, and as a result maybe also come a closer to answering the question of NYCâ€™s 200-year triumph. We hope that by presenting these essential parts of NYC history we can show patterns in the overall history of New York thus pushing the boundaries for urban knowledge. We will map two important parts of development in the history of NYC, its commercializational development and its migrational development. We look into the commercialisational development of NYC, as we want to understand better how NYC has developed to become such a rich city with the second highest GDP in the world. We look into migrational development as a lot of the cultural and historical identity of NYC is inadvertently tied to its status as a city build by migrants (https://www.osc.state.ny.us/files/reports/osdc/pdf/report-7-2016.pdf). Thus we hope by visualizing patterns in the urbanisational development of NYC with commercialization and migration as our points of interest, we become able to see the historical effects through time, while understanding contemporary NYC better.
